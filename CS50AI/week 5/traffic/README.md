# Experimentation with Project
There were many things that were being experiemented one throughout the project. One of the main things that I had to adjust, was figuring out was the actual dropout. As adjusting this value meant that the output would be overfitted or not, by having less dropout the likelyhood of causing overfitting increased. While vice-versa could be said that if the amount of dropout was increased then the likelyhood of overfitting was decreased.

Along with this, another thing that I had to sort of tweak throughout the whole implementation, were the pooling sizes. As increasing the pooling would resize the images so that it becomes more "digestable" for the algorithm to perform. However if you make your pooling sizes to big it can cause some error in the algorithm in the fact that it is smaller. Rather than if you decrease the pooling sizes the chances of the algorithm unable to have enough compute power in order to generate the output is decreased.
