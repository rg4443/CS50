# CS50 Repository About

This repository stores some of the problem-set solutions, and final projects that I came up with for the courses: CS50AI--an introductory course to Artificial Intelligence, CS50P--an introductory course to Python, and CS50C which is the first six weeks of the base CS50 course that used the C programming language.

# List of Courses & Assignments

## CS50AI:
### Week 0:
1. Tic-Tac-Toe: Implements a minimax algorithm to train an AI to play tic-tac-toe with the most optimal moves.
2. Degrees: Using a Breadth-First-Search algorithm to find the shortest path bewteen actors through their movie roles.

### Week 1:
1. Knights: Uses propositional logic, and model checking to solve "Knights And Knaves" logic puzzles.
2. Minesweeper: AI that can play Minesweeper optimally.

### Week 2:
1. Heredity: Uses probablity and bayesian networks to infer what a child's genes are based on the genes of the parents.
2. Pagerank: Ultilizes PageRank algorithm to rank web pages based on importance.

### Week 3: 
1. Crossword: Generates crossword puzzle using algorithms, and dictionarys.

### Week 4:
1. Nim: AI that can play Nim via reinforcement learning.
2. Shopping: Predicts if a customer would complete a purchase based on user data.

### Week 5:
1. Traffic: AI that can detect stop-signs using Convulutional Neural Networks.

### Week 6: 
1. Attention: Examaines a neural networks way of generating weights on specifc words in a sentence.
2. Parser: Parses sentences.

## CS50P
1. Final Project: A csv writer capable of writing, and copying a section/column from one csv file into another.
2. Others: Too many, and too lazy to describe all... (Beginner course, so all are self-explanatory when looking at corresponding files).

## CS50C (First six weeks of main CS50 Course foucusing on C)
### Week 1: 
1. Mario-More: Creating a visual representation of mario pyramid structures using hashes, and for loops.
2. Others (Self-explanatory).

### Week 2: 
1. Readablity: Uses Coleman-Liau index to determine the grade level of a text.
2. Scrabble: Simulates Scrabble Game.
3. Subsitution: Implements substitution cypher.

### Week 3:
1. Plurality: Simulates an Election that uses plurality voting.
2. Sort: Determine which algorithm sorted text files.

### Week 4:
1. Filter-more: Advanced version of filter assignment that applies filters on images by changing the rgb values of pixels.
2. Recover: A program that is able to recover deleted JPEG images from a memory card.
3. Volume: Adjusts the volume of an audio file.

### Week 5:
1. Inheritance: Create a family tree based on inheritance of alleles, and genes.
2. Speller: A spell checker that implements a hash table to store a dictionary of words.

### Unsolved:
All problem-sets in this folder are solved, just didn't recieve the maximum grade and are in need of improvements.

Note: Some of these implementations were from a few years back, so some solutions, and problem-sets that were on the original course aren't shown here (I haven't been able to recover/find them). Additionally, some implementations were altered from my original solution for better functionality, and structure.
