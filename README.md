# CS50 Repository About

This repository stores some of the problem-set solutions, and final projects that I came up with for the courses: CS50AI--an introductory course to Artificial Intelligence, CS50P--an introductory course to Python, and CS50C which is the first six weeks of the CS50 course that used the C programming language.

# List of Assignments

### CS50AI:

1. Tic-Tac-Toe: Implements a minimax algorithm to train an AI to play tic-tac-toe with the most optimial moves.
2. Degrees: Using a Breadth-First-Search algorithm, finds the shortest path bewteen actors through their movie roles.
3. Heredity: With the usage of probablity and bayesian networks begin to infer what genes a child has based on the genes of the parents.
4. Minesweeper: Artificial Intelligence that can play Minesweeper.
5. Nim: AI that can play Nim using reinforcement learning.

### CS50P

1. Final Project: For the final project for CS50P I implemented a csv writer capable of writing, and copying one section/column from one csv file into another.

### CS50C (First six weeks of main CS50 Course foucusing on C)

1. Mario-More: Creating a visual representation of mario pyramid structures using hashes and for loops.
2. Speller: A spell checker that implements a hash table to store a dictionary of words.
3. Recover: A program that is able to recover deleted JPEG images from a memory card.

Note: Some of these implementations were from a few years back, so some solutions, and problem-sets that were on the original course aren't shown here (I haven't been able to recover/find them). Additionally, some implementations were altered from my original solution for better functionality, and structure.
